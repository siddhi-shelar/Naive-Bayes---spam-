# Naive-Bayes---spam-

This project implements a Spam Email Detection System using the Naive Bayes Machine Learning algorithm. The goal is to classify emails as Spam or Not Spam (Ham) based on their textual content. The project demonstrates a simple yet effective Natural Language Processing (NLP) workflow suitable for beginners in Machine Learning.
The model is trained using labeled email data and applies probabilistic classification to predict whether a message is spam.
